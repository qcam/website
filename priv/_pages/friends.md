There's an old Internet saying that

> If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

To be honest, I don't give a üí© about fast and far. But since they
recommended me on their blogs, it'd be polite to link them back.

So, here are a couple of sites I would recommend you to check out.
