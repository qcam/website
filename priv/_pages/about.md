### Hi there!

I am Cẩm, a back-end developer working in Gothenburg, Sweden. I write (and
delete) code most of the time, and am a former part-time dumplings maker at
[162 Sủi Cảo](https://facebook.com/suicao162).

I love football (non-American) and am a die-hard fan of [Chelsea FC](http://chelseafc.com).

Right now I am working at [Football Addicts](https://footballaddicts.com), the
home of the great football app [Forza Football](http://www.footballaddicts.com/apps/).

Still feel curious about me? Check out my [resume](/rbcv),
my [blog](/essays/), or drop me an email at huynhquancam at Gmail dot com.
